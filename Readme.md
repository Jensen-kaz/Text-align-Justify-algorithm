Algorithm corresponds to requirements.

Requirements:

Use spaces to fill in the gaps between words. <br>
Each line should contain as many words as possible. <br>
Use '\n' to separate lines. <br>
Gap between words can't differ by more than one space. <br>
Lines should end with a word not a space. <br>
'\n' is not included in the length of a line. <br>
Large gaps go first, then smaller ones: 'Lorem---ipsum---dolor--sit--amet' (3, 3, 2, 2 spaces). <br>
Last line should not be justified, use only one space between words. <br>
Last line should not contain '\n' <br>
Strings with one word do not need gaps ('somelongword\n').
